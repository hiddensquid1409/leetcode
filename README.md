# LeetCode Practice Problem Solutions


This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems. I am using this repository to keep track of my progress and to help others who are stuck on a problem. I will be adding solutions to problems as I solve them. The solutions to the problems will include the following languages:

    - Python
    - JavaScript (soon)

I will be adding solutions to problems in the following categories:
    
        - Easy 
        - Medium
        - Hard ( Not many of them ðŸ˜‚)
    

Most probably I will be going through diffrent leetcode study programs and you will be able to find those problems on their corresponding folder. Aditionally, I will be uploading also the daily streak problems.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. I will be happy to include more questions, solutions and languages to this repository.


## Sidenote ðŸ’¡ 

All of the problems will have the description and the link to the problem as the docstring of the file
